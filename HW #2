#Intro to R - Homework #2 ggplot - Sept 30, 2015

### Load needed libraries for the homework
```
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
library(ggplot2)

```



## Plot 1 - create graph of the gdpPercap (x) compared to life expectancy (Y) of each continent

* convert df to tbl and group by vaules - because this is what we did in class
```
lifeExp_gdp_df <-
  gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, lifeExp, gdpPercap)
  
```

* then plot -- like we did in class
```
ggplot(data = lifeExp_gdp_df, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point(aes(shape = continent)) + geom_point(aes(color = continent)) 

```


## Plot 2 - Use "transformation" to linerise the data -- lm? ug... ahh a hint on the hw page -- so a "log scale" 
*yep... there is one in ggplot... so not the "lm" function I was trying to figure out_ 
```
ggplot(data = lifeExp_gdp_df, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point(aes(shape = continent)) + geom_point(aes(color = continent)) + scale_x_log10()

```

## Plot 3 - Include a simple "linear fit" to the transformed area
* googled "linear fit" to get "regression line" and then got -- geom_smooth(method=lm)
```
ggplot(data = lifeExp_gdp_df, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point(aes(shape = continent)) + geom_point(aes(color = continent)) + scale_x_log10() + geom_smooth(method=lm)

```

## Plot 4 - plot the density functions of the life expectency for each continent
```
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = , color = continent )) +geom_area(stat="bin") + facet_grid(lifeExp ~ continent)

```

* hmmm.... unexpected variables... yes... (above code brought on pages and pages of the text below)

>This can result in unexpected behavior and will not be allowed in a future version of ggplot2.
If you want y to represent counts of cases, use stat="bin" and don't map a variable to y.
If you want y to represent values in the data, use stat="identity".
See ?geom_bar for examples. (Defunct; last used in version 0.9.2)
Error : Mapping a variable to y and also using stat="bin".
With stat="bin", it will attempt to set the y value to the count of cases in each group.
This can result in unexpected behavior and will not be allowed in a future version of ggplot2.
If you want y to represent counts of cases, use stat="bin" and don't map a #variable to y.
If you want y to represent values in the data, use stat="identity".

* ok - so no "y"?? ... nope y=lifeExp
* well - something popped up but then disappeared..  wtf??

* testing previous code
```
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, color = continent )) + geom_boxplot() 
```

* somethings not right... no plots being displayed anymore...
## reset Rstudio...  trying something new

```
gdp_df <-
  gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, lifeExp)
ggplot(data =gdp_df, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point(aes(shape = continent)) + geom_point(aes(color = continent)) 
```

* ok... this works

```
ggplot(data = gdp_df, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(year~continent)
```
* wrong plot type but the grid looks promising

```
ggplot(data = gdp_df, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(year~continent)
```
* #nope...

```
ggplot(data = gdp_df, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  geom_area() +  facet_wrap(~year)
```
* #nope... 

```
ggplot(data = gdp_df, aes(x = continent, y = , color = continent)) + 
  geom_density() +  facet_wrap(~year)
  
```
* #as close as Im going to try... yes it needs to be shaded... running out of time.


## Plot 5 - fix the wording...  create the plot first of course.... well - it's a boxplot based on the above trials... 
```
ggplot(data = gdp_df, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +  facet_wrap(~year)
```
* #(ummm... just widen the screen... mine looks just fine at full screen..??)
* # ggplot cheat sheet says something about using scale function when looking at the "Labels" tab... don't see how to do this..)
```
ggplot(data = gdp_df, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +  facet_wrap(~year) + theme_minimal()
```

* #like the minimal theme - but it didn't fix the text...  looks like it could be "scale_fill_discrete" 
```
ggplot(data = gdp_df, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +  facet_wrap(~year) + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_discrete()
```

* #giving up... googling it... 
```
ggplot(data = gdp_df, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +  facet_wrap(~year) + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=50, size=10, vjust=0.5))
+ scale_fill_discrete()
```
