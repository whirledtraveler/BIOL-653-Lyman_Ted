And another  
~~ and another ~~  
~~ and another ~~ 


I created the repository on GitHub under my account and made the
original *__README.md__* file within the GitHub webpage.  Once there, I issued a pull request in RStudio. I got an error and found that I needed to use term to authenticate to the github repository.  Once that was done, "pull" worked and I was able to edit the file in RStudio.  Got some odd errors when trying to commit the changes and while I am still not sure why, I had restart RStuio and then resolve a duplication conflict and recommit.
